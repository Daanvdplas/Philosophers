# Philosophers

Making the philosophers game, using threads and mutexes.

# To run

To run the project, you have to add 4 of 5 arguments.
- arg 1: number of philosophers.
- arg 2: time a philosopher can live without eating.
- arg 3: time a philosopher needs to eat.
- arg 4: time a philosopher needs to sleep.
- arg 5: number of meals the philosophers need to eat (optional).
	* without specifying arg 5 the program runs till a philosopher dies.

# Progress

For this project I learned to use threads and mutexes. In addition, I tried out VIM
as a text editor and will use it as my go-to text editor. Last, I wrote short 
explanations for functions for the first time. Will keep doing this from now on.
